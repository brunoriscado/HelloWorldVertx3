  "description" : [ "Postman Gordon (David Arquette) has long nursed a crush on his neighbour Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), so when she is called out of town on business and asks Gordon to babysit her young son James for a few days, he sees his chance to make an impression and eagerly accepts.  Gordon and James have fun together, eating junk food and watching TV, and soon discover a stray bulldog in the back of Gordon's van and name him Spot.  However, unbeknownst to them, Spot has been working for the FBI on a case targetting the mafia, and after attacking mob boss Sonny Talia (Paul Sorvino), he now has a price on his head. So with the mafia on their trail, a few days spent with the canine crimebuster could prove very exciting indeed for Gordon and James." ],
